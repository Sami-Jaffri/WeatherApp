# WeatherApp - Providing Accurate Weather Reports
 

# ðŸ’» What Is It? 
Acting as a personal project, this weather app was created with the main goal of attempting to learn basic API, and diving deeper into the 
intricacies of JavaScript. Using the openweathermap.org API along with the SourceUnsplash API I was able to construct a website
capable of delivering accurate, and informative, weather reports with the search of a button. This project accomplished its goal and allowed me 
to get famliliar with the uses, and benefits of using API's in my projects. Furthermore, I feel more confident in my JavaScript abliities.
